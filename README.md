# ESP-DSP
[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)
The ESP Digital Signal Processing firmware is an open source project developed mainly for educational purposes. Filters can be designed and send to the device using the ESP-DSP-Desktop application. The raw signal and filtered signal can be compared and filtered frequencies can be seen using an FFT. This project uses I2S and DMA capabilities of the ESP32 board for minimum processor interaction. Communication is done using Bluetooth.
